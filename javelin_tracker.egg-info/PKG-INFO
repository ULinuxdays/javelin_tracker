# Throws Tracker

Command-line utilities for logging sessions, analysing workloads, and generating reports for throwing events (javelin, discus, shot, hammer, or custom).

## Installation

Choose the workflow that matches your environment. See `docs/INSTALL.md` for platform notes and troubleshooting.

### PyPI / pipx

```bash
pip install throws-tracker   # formerly published as javelin-tracker
# or
pipx install throws-tracker
```

### From source (developer setup)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Set `THROWS_TRACKER_DATA_DIR` (legacy `JAVELIN_TRACKER_DATA_DIR`) if you want the CLI to store sessions outside the default `data/` directory (e.g. `export THROWS_TRACKER_DATA_DIR=~/.local/share/throws`).

## Quick Start

```bash
javelin log --event javelin --throws "61.4, 60.8, 62.1" --rpe 6 --duration-minutes 55
javelin log --event discus --best 55.3 --fouls 1
javelin summary --event shot --by week
javelin plot --event javelin --event discus
javelin export --event javelin --to export/sessions
javelin weekly-report --athlete esha --event discus --week-ending 2024-06-09
```

Show the active config (allowed events, ACWR thresholds) any time with `javelin config`.

Use `python -m javelin_tracker seed --source demo/demo_sessions.json --force` to bootstrap a dataset for experimentation.

## Demo sandbox & synthetic data

- `scripts/generate_demo_data.py` creates deterministic demo logs (`demo/demo_sessions.{json,csv}`).
- `javelin seed --source demo/demo_sessions.json --force` copies the synthetic data into `data/sessions.json`.
- The Docker entrypoint accepts `THROWS_TRACKER_BOOTSTRAP_DEMO=1` (or the legacy `JAVELIN_TRACKER_BOOTSTRAP_DEMO=1`) to seed the container automatically (see below).

More detailed instructions live in `docs/demo-sandbox.md`.

## Docker image

Build and run the ready-to-use image:

```bash
docker build -t throws-tracker .
docker run --rm -it \
  -e THROWS_TRACKER_BOOTSTRAP_DEMO=1 \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
  throws-tracker summary
```

The container runs as a non-root `throws` user and writes sessions to `/data` (mounted as a volume by default).

## Testing, linting & CI

- `pytest` runs the unit suite plus a CLI smoke test (`tests/test_smoke_cli.py`).
- `ruff check .` enforces linting and formatting guidelines.
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint + tests on Python 3.9, 3.11, and 3.12 for every push/pull request.

## Packaging & releases

The project ships as a standard PEP 621 package (`pyproject.toml`) with console entry points `javelin` and `throws`. Use the following to produce an sdist/wheel and publish:

```bash
rm -rf dist
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

Detailed release, container, compliance, and Zenodo DOI notes live in `docs/RELEASING.md`.

## Directory layout

- `javelin_tracker/` – CLI commands, metrics, report generation, and storage helpers
- `tests/` – Pytest suite (unit tests + smoke CLI coverage)
- `demo/` – Synthetic sample data for sandboxing and demos
- `scripts/` – Utility scripts (demo data generator, Docker entrypoint)
- `docs/` – Methodology, installation, compliance, and sandbox guides

Refer to `docs/` for deeper dives into workload calculations, deployment environments, and demo data flows.
